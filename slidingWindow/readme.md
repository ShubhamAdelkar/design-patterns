# Sliding Window Pattern

The sliding window pattern involves maintaining a set of elements within a "window" of a fixed size that slides through the input data, one element at a time. This pattern is particularly useful for solving problems that require finding subarrays, sublists, or subsequences that meet certain conditions.

The basic idea of the sliding window pattern can be summarized in the following steps:

``1. Initialize Pointers and Variables:``

Define two pointers (or indices) to represent the boundaries of the current window. These pointers help in moving and resizing the window as needed.
Maintain additional variables or data structures to track relevant information within the window.

``2. Expand the Window:``

Move the right pointer to expand the window to the right, adding elements to the current window.

``3. Contract the Window:``

If the current window violates a certain condition or becomes invalid, move the left pointer to contract the window from the left, removing elements.

``4. Update Result:``

Update the result or perform any required computations based on the elements within the current window.

``5. Repeat:``

Repeat steps 2-4 until the right pointer reaches the end of the input data.

The sliding window pattern is often employed to optimize the time complexity of algorithms by avoiding redundant computations. It is commonly used in problems that involve finding subarrays with a specific sum, substring patterns, or solving optimization problems where the goal is to find the maximum or minimum value of a certain function over all possible subarrays.
