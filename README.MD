# Design Patterns in Data Structures and Algorithms âœ¨

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns commonly used in data structures and algorithms. Each pattern is accompanied by examples and explanations to help you understand their usage and benefits.

## 1. Frequency Counter Pattern

### Description

The Frequency Counter Pattern is a technique used to compare two or more sets of data by counting the frequency of distinct elements. It is particularly useful in solving problems that involve comparing and analyzing the frequency of elements in arrays, strings, or other data structures.

### Examples

- Checking if two strings are anagrams.
- Finding if an array contains duplicate elements.
- Determining if two arrays are permutations of each other.
